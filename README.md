Local JSON is a feature in Advanced Custom Fields Pro which saves field group and field settings as JSON files.

In short, the three main benefits to this feature are;

* Speeds up ACF as it reduces the amount of database queries on page load.
* Allows multiple devs to work on a project, use git to push / pull files, and keep all databases synchronized with the latest field group settings.
* Allows for version control over your field settings.

Usually, for this feature the files need to be stored inside a WordPress theme. This plugin just makes use of the filters to change the directory that ACF searches for, so they can be stored inside this plugin. Built especially for [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/) where the theme is completely disabled.

See the official documentation, [overview of Local JSON in ACF](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/) for a better understanding.
